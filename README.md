# ML Wellness AI Assignment

Welcome to the **ML Wellness AI Assignment** repository!  
This project is part of my application for the AI Associate position and showcases my skills in Machine Learning, Data Science, and practical AI application development.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered wellness solution. The assignment demonstrates the following:

- **Data preprocessing and cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature engineering**
- **Model selection and training**
- **Evaluation and insights**
- **Deployment/usage instructions**

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project contains synthetically created wellness-related data such as physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and self-reported health metrics.
- Data sources are either open-source or synthetic.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdullah-47/ML_Wellness_AI_Assigment.git
    cd ML_Wellness_AI_Assigment
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

## How to Run

- **Colab Notebooks:**  
  Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook and if required install dependencies such as
    ```bash
    !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn scipy joblib
    ```
## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Encoding categorical variables.

2. **EDA:**  
   Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand patterns and correlations.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   Creation of synthetic features to improve model performance.

4. **Model Selection:**  
   Comparison of algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressor) using cross-validation.

5. **Evaluation:**  
   Metrics such as MSE, R2.

6. **Interpretation:**  
   Feature importance analysis and actionable insights.

## Results

- Summary of the best model's performance
- Key findings and insights

## Future Work

- Hyperparameter tuning for further improvements
- Integration with a web/mobile front-end for real-world use
- Deployment using cloud platforms or Docker
